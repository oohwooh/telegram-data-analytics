#TELEGRAM DATA ANALYTICS
It's not really analytics but this is some (very bad) code to generate markov chains based on messages you send

##Instructions to run/important things to change during use
- 1.) Export data from telegram (this gives you `result.json` - put that in the folder)
* b.) change line 30 (as of writing) with your telegram from_id (look in the data export to figure this one out, it's weird and not the same as your regular telegram id)
- IIV.) change lines 31 and 38 (also as of time of writing) to your pleasure - i probably won't ever make this much better with like arguments and stuff
